# **Group Project - COMP 440 Database Design**

## **Overview**

This login and user registration interface is intended to be a secure system that only allows a registered user to login into the system.

---

## **Key Features**

- **User Registration**: New accounts and usernames and passwords should be unique.
- **Secure Login**: Login using a registered username and password.
- **Data Validation**: Checks that authorized users provide correct data when registering and logging in.
- **Password Encryption**: Encrypts passwords using hashed algorithms and then stores them in the database.
- **Interactive GUI**: A clean and well-organised user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Error Handling**: Deals with bad input, duplicate applications and system errors gracefully.
